  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>I guess this is the section I'm supposed to talk about myself. There really isn't much to say but since the purpose of this site
    <br>is to learn and test HTML code, I suppose I will give a little bit of my programming background. Let me start by saying that
    <br>I am in no way a programmer. It has been something I have messed with a few times in my life by never really stuck with.
    <br>My earliest memories of programming was using QBASIC on my old Atari XE system. I then did some C programming as a
    <br>teen and in college. I took a couple of Visual Basic courses in college as well. Lastly, recently I've done some (very little)
    <br>Unity and C# coding. I'm hoping that I stick with this HTML learning as I have a tendency to lose interest in stuff rather quickly.

  <h3>Eduction</h3>
  <p>I've taken some classes from the College of Insurance in NY (now part of St. Johns). I took some courses from Berkley College
    <br>in New York. I received my Associates Degree from Mount Wachusett Community College. Lastly, I have roughly 4 or 5 classes
    <br>away from my Bachelors from UMASS Lowell. I've stopped going to college so it's unlikely I'll ever get to finish my bachelors
    <br>but only time will tell.
